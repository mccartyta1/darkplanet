Not much to it. Game I've been kinda working on for the past couple months.
Based off of the tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dzhgsVaiSo">here.</a>

Features include:
  Pew pew at enemies.
  Upgrade ship at planets.
  Modify energy levels of ship's systems. (Shields, Engines, and Weapons)
  Very basic quest system that I don't remember if it is finished.

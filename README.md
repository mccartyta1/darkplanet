Ship game I've been kinda working on for the past couple months.
Somewhat based off of the tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dzhgsVaiSo">here.</a>
(Recommend for anyone wanting to start programming their own games in general, as his tutorial helps explain the concepts and how to represent those in code.)


# Features:
Pew pew at enemies as well as "neutrals" that give more points.

Upgrade ship at planets.

Modify energy levels of ship's systems, bringing in a dynamic of swapping power to different systems for different moments. (Shields, Engines, and Weapons)

Very basic quest system that needs work.

# Future Goals:
Cleaner and generally better User Interface.

Boss Battles.

Reputation System (Neutral ships and Allied ships will reduce reputation if shot at.)

Finished Quest System.
